<p class="fg">
We, the community members from teachers
and researchers to other staff members
and students, at Acropolis aspire to 
establish a system of quality assurance,<br>
which would on a continuous basis evaluate
and monitor the quality of education and
training imparted at the institute;
improve the teaching and learning process;
and ultimately develop the institute as a
center of excellence. We will, thus, be
contributing to the growth of quality<br>
technical education by upholding the 
highest ethical and professional standards.

<p class="abc">AITR has always been at the forefront of adopting new technologies. CSIT  department @ AITR has three courses those include the emerging areas as recommended by the AICTE committee. As exponential growth in information on various platforms, future engineers must have the expertise in core computer science as well as latest technologies. It requires blending of emerging areas with core subject and therefore AICTE introduced as new branch CSIT.
</p>
<p class="abc">The courses @ CSIT incorporate both theory and practicals/labs in the emerging areas of AI, ML, IoT, Blockchain and Data Sciences as core subjects and Quantum Computing, Virtual Reality and Cyber Security as Professional Electives. The above emerging areas have been identified by the national level committee as part of National Perspective Plan for Engineering Education and accepted by AICTE. AICTE has also prescribed the model curriculum for the above emerging areas.
</p>
<p class="abc">The course @ CSIT is in the AICTE nomenclature and accepted by them as equivalent to CSE and IT. The courses bring the best of both CSE and IT together. The course @ CSIT will be accepted as being similar / relevant to CSE and IT and will also be accepted for campus recruitments, not only in private companies but also in government undertakings etc. The graduates of the courses @ CSIT will be accepted even for any faculty recruitments for the departments of CSE or IT or CSIT. The graduates will also be eligible for higher education (both in India and abroad).

<hr class="gh"> 
<p class="abc">The graduates of the new course of CSIT will find employment not only in the regular services industry but also in the emerging areas mentioned above; those are specialized in nature and will command much higher salaries. CSIT graduates will therefore have more opportunities than the graduates of CSE and IT courses. Opportunities exist in the area of Design Engineering, Computing/IT Consulting and Solution Developers.
In Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), the student studies designing, implementation, and management of information systems of both software and hardware processes. In Information Technology (IT) the student studies the area which involves installation, development, and implementation of computer systems and applications. Whereas blending of CSIT prepare students for futuristic applications.
